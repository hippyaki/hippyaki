# Namaste🙏

I am an IoT Engineer currently working at **Schneider Electric**. I specialize in building connected solutions and am deeply interested in the intersection of hardware, cloud connectivity, and edge computing.

---

### 🚀 What I Do

* **IoT on Edge:** I love tinkering and computing on the edge. Pushing them to its limits, and using it's network capabilities for telemetry.
* **Full Stack:** Since beginning, focused on full fledged projects. i.e. the frontend, backend and all hosting requirements for public use. On AWS, GCP as well as a PC (for low traffic with a public IP - definitely unsafe).
* **Micro Man:** I primarily use micrcontrollers for plug-and-play devices, and for full control and higher compute power, microprocessors give a better use-case. 
* **SLAM Navigation:** After successfully building an autonomous 2-wheel-differential and 4-wheel-differential robot, made use of LiDAR-only SLAM for optimized navigation. Now quadreped has my interest.
* **Purpose-driven Projects:** If we ever discuss, you will always find me actively working on a side-project. Not only for learning new tech, or skills, but something that serves a purpose for the people. Something only I can sell, something you cant buy from amazon - not yet.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Languages:** C/C++, Embedded C, Python, JavaScript, Dart, Bash
* **Hardware:** ESP32, STM32, Tivaware, Raspberry Pi, nRF Board
* **Interests:** Automation, Firmware Development, and UI/UX for Mobile and Web apps

### Let's Connect

I'm always looking to learn from others and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with connected hardware.

* 💬 Ask me about: **IoT Architecture, Embedded C, or solving Rubik's cubes!**
* 📫 Reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshayansinha/) or open an issue on one of my repos.
